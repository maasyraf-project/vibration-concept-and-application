#Simple Harmonic Motion

Simple harmonic motion has several characteristic, which define the motion of an object included
on SHM or not.

1. The amplitude is constant
2. The frequency is constant
3. Can be represented on sinus or cosinus function
4. It is periodically movement (zero crossing)
5. Have constant peak-to-peak value
